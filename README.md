# ProjectSparky

This is my attempt at building a SmartScreen (Echo Show) in UWP based on Cortana and running on a Raspberry Pi 3b with the official touch screen attached.

**NOTE:** Windows IoT on the Raspberry Pi does not have hardware accelerated graphics, as a result it is impossible to control the screen brightness.  
Which in turn makes it impossible to dim the screen at night time.  Which in turn does not make it an attractive Smart Screen.  I am hoping with the Raspberry Pi 4,
Windows IoT will gain hardware accelerated graphics.
